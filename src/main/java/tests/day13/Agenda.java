    Today is 11/22/2019
    Agenda:
        finish git practice, that we started yesterday
        automation practice with vytrack application
#########################################
    git is a version control tool
    it keeps track of changes that were made
    git remember who did changes, when and what kind of changes
    it helps to collaborate, so multiple developers can easily work together on the same project
    Also, git is a distributed version control system (DVCS).
    Main version of the project will be in the cloud (for example github)
github it's a google driver for git projects/repositories
    for project we create a git repository.
    we have local repository (on your computer)
    and we have remote repository (on github)
    git know about changes in your project
    github works as cloud storage for your project
    The process of getting a copy of project call cloning
    git clone - stands for getting a copy of project from remote repository (github)
PLease comeback at 3:15
git init - initialize local repository for project
git add . - prepare files for commit
git commit -m "commit message" - commit code (take a snapshot)
git push - send updated project to github
Don't forget to connect local repo with remote!
First create repo on github and then github will show instruction.
Invite only for Elvira, sorry
//command that will connect local and remote repo
//CybertekSchool it's my github username, instead you should see yours
git remote add origin https://github.com/CybertekSchool/Summer2019GitPractice.git
git remote set-url origin <YOUR GITHUB LINK>
last command, it runs only once, then just git push:
 git push -u origin master
=====
git log - to see history of commits. :q - to exit from the log
9a0efc024577ed2cc458aa6b4af6c062df732d5d - always different, it calls commit id
commit 9a0efc024577ed2cc458aa6b4af6c062df732d5d (HEAD -> master, origin/master)

    added student class
What you need to know:
   When you will get a laptop, at work, you need to clone project (get a copy)
   Then, pull (to get updates)
   and push to send your updates
Usually I pull in a morning, and at the the day before commit.
I push code at the end of the day. If I didn't finish something, I will push once I will be done with script/task. No need to push every 30 minutes.
