    How do you do peer/code review in your current project?
Every team member pushes their code to their branch in GitHub.
Then After testing the code himself, he/she creates a PR(Pull Request).
Then we as a team sit and review the code and give feedback. If everything looks good and code is in the standards of our project and framework.
Team lead merges the changes to master branch.
After the master of GitHub is updated, all team member can now pull those changes to their local master branches.
===================
Best Practice based on our Git WorkFlow:
--> commit all new changes to your local feature branch
--> Do not commit to the local master
--> Regularly Pull Remote master to your local master
--> Merge new changes in your local master to your local feature branch
==========================
